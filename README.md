Factorio Production Cells (the name's a work in progress...) is a website intended to help Factorio players plan out their bases by allowing them to quickly and easily create "production cells" - groups of recipes and the machines they're produced in - that are intended to be implemented as a single unit within the game. Production cells allow players to focus on just the inputs and outputs of a production process by abstracting away intermediate materials and processes, which in turn allows them to spend more time designing their base and less time worrying about exact production ratios.

## Planned Features
* Creation of production cells, or collections of recipes and machines that they're to be performed in, along with the quantity of each.
* Automatic balancing of recipes within a production cell, eliminating intermediate products.
* Selection of modules and beacons to be applied to a machine within a production cell.
* User profiles, which will allow users to save their production cells and edit them later.
* Recursive production cells, which allow players to reference a previously saved production cell inside a new one.
* Specific version selection for both the base game and mods, so the tool is never out of sync with your game file.
* Support for complex mods, such as Bob's Mods, Angel's Ores, and many more!

## Examples
Coming soon(-ish)...
